ERROR! We were unable to read either as JSON nor YAML, these are the errors we got from each:
JSON: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

Syntax Error while loading YAML.
  did not find expected key. while parsing a block mapping
  in "<unicode string>", line 14, column 3
did not find expected key
  in "<unicode string>", line 17, column 24

The error appears to be in '/home/bakvivas/Documents/Projects/ansible-role-3x-ui/roles/3x_ui_container/tasks/start_container.yml': line 17, column 24, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

    msg: "No variable vpn_username need"
  when: 'vpn_username' in extravars.keys()
                       ^ here
This one looks easy to fix. It seems that there is a value started
with a quote, and the YAML parser is expecting to see the line ended
with the same kind of quote. For instance:

    when: "ok" in result.stdout

Could be written as:

   when: '"ok" in result.stdout'

Or equivalently:

   when: "'ok' in result.stdout"
