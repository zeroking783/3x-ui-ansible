ERROR! We were unable to read either as JSON nor YAML, these are the errors we got from each:
JSON: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

Syntax Error while loading YAML.
  did not find expected key. while parsing a block mapping
  in "<unicode string>", line 16, column 5
did not find expected key
  in "<unicode string>", line 16, column 23

The error appears to be in '/home/bakvivas/Documents/Projects/ansible-role-3x-ui/roles/3x_ui_container/tasks/start_container.yml': line 16, column 23, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

  debug:
    msg: '{{ default('vpn_username') }}'
                      ^ here
We could be wrong, but this one looks like it might be an issue with
missing quotes. Always quote template expression brackets when they
start a value. For instance:

    with_items:
      - {{ foo }}

Should be written as:

    with_items:
      - "{{ foo }}"
